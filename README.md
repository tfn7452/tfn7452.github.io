# Thomas Neruda Github Page
I'm Thomas Neruda, I attended Weymouth High School in Massachusetts. I've always loved programming, which is partly why I chose Software Engineering. I also love music, I play the Tuba and Trumpet and was in band throughout my high school years. Massachusetts is a long way away for me, so moving to Rochester was a big deal. I think I love it here at RIT and I can't wait to learn more.

- I'm excited to help create new projects and just innovate in this world full of change.
- I also am excited to meet people and make connections not only with my team but within the whole class.
- Getting out in the workforce seems like a long way away but I'm excited about my journey getting there!
